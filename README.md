# cell-segmentation-using-cellpose
Cellpose is a deep learning network that is generalizable across diverse cell microscopy images and automatically segments single cells to improve throughput and reduce inter-human biases. This study aims to validate Cellpose for autofluorescence imaging, specifically using multiphoton intensity images of NAD(P)H.
